<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our team comprises of five second-year computer science undergraduates from
the National University of Singapore (NUS).</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-the-project"><a class="link" href="#about-the-project">1.2. About the project</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project is a 6 weeks long project for our software engineering module.
We were tasked to either enhance or morph a command line interface
Address Book application and one of the main constraints for this project is that
it has to remain as a command line interface application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we decided to do was to morph the existing address book application to a team
management application called Athletick. Athletick is designed for captains and
coaches of timing-based performance sports to help take and keep track of attendance
and performance of their teams. Other main features of Athletick include viewing of the training calendar
and performance graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to design and implement the code for the <code>undo</code> and <code>redo</code> features.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as
well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides
in relation to these enhancements.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>undo</code> command allows the user to undo a previous command. The user may
reverse this <code>undo</code> command with the <code>redo</code> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the event that users have made a mistake or changed their minds about executing
a command, the <code>undo</code> command enables them to revert to a version immediately before the mistaken command
was executed. If they change their minds again and decide to execute the command after all,
then the <code>redo</code> command enables them to do so easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An in-depth analysis of design
alternatives was necessary to weigh the different alternatives and decide on the implementation for this enhancement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation was challenging as it required a full understanding of
the major components of the application and the existing features implementations.
Also, the enhancement had to be implemented in a way that the future enhancements for any future
features are able to be easily integrated into the current implementation.</p>

<h4 id="undo-implementation"><a class="link" href="#undo-implementation">4.1.1. Undo Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>undo</code> command is facilitated by the <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code>. <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code> holds the
states of <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code>, <code><span class="green">Attendance</span></code> and <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code>, which are kept in
their respective stacks governed by <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code>. Furthermore, <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code> also
holds the <code><span class="green">Command</span></code> stack that keeps track of the commands executed by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each time after the user executes a command, the command will be pushed to the
<code><span class="green">Command</span></code> stack. Also, following the execution of the command,
changes to either <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code>,<code><span class="green">Attendance</span></code> or <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code>
will result in the new state being pushed into their respective stacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario on how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code> will be
initialised with the initial <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code>, <code><span class="green">Attendance</span></code> and
<code><span class="green">Performance</span></code> state pushed to the respective stacks.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Initial stacks of states</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The user executes the <code>delete -p 3</code> command to delete the 3rd person in the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> list. The
delete command will be pushed into the <code><span class="green">Command</span></code> stack. After that,
since the <code>delete -p 3</code> command only alters the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state, the new <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code>
state will then be pushed to the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> stack while the <code><span class="green">Attendance</span></code> and
<code><span class="green">Performance</span></code> stacks are left untouched as their states remain the same.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Stacks of states after <code>delete -p 3</code> command</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The user now decides that deleting the 3rd person in the list was a mistake, and decides to undo the action
by executing the <code>undo</code> command. The <code>undo</code> command then executes the <code>undo</code> method in the
<code><span class="green">ModelManager</span></code>. This pops the latest command from the <code><span class="green">Command</span></code>
stack and the latest <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state from the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> stack.
It then peeks at the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> stack to retrieve the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state
before <code>delete -p 3</code> command was executed.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Stacks of states after <code>undo</code> command</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. After retrieving the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state before <code>delete -p 3</code> command
was executed, we then reset the <code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state to this retrieved
<code><span class="green">Athletick</span></code> state. As such, the previous command will then be undone.</p>

which are kept in their respective undone stacks governed by <code><span class="green">HistoryManager</span></code>. Furthermore,

undone by the user.</p>
