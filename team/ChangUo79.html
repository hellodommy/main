<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project was done in a group of five, consisting of Shawn, Dominique, Jeun Hoe, Jun Hup and me. We are second-year
students in National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Computer Science.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project is part of a software engineering module that I took during my second year. We were tasked to optimize
or morph a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop addressbook application for this project. We decided to morph the
application into a team management application called Athletick which caters to time-based sports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application enables coaches or captains to manage their team by recording attendance for
training sessions as well as track the performances of their athletes. One of the constraints set for this project is
that the primary input to the application has to be CLI as it is meant for users who can type fast and prefer typing
over the use of mouse. The duration of this project spanned over a period of 6 weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what Athletick looks like when coaches or captains first launch the application:</p>

<p>This section shows a summary of my contributions to the team project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added:</strong> I added the ability to view an athlete&#8217;s profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The <code>select</code> command allows users to view the profile of an individual athlete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: There will be occasions when coaches or captains would like to track the progress of an athlete. The
<code>select</code> command allows them to view the athlete&#8217;s personal information such as the name, phone number and email
address. The attendance rate and performance of the athlete is also displayed so that it is easier to monitor instead
of looking at the attendance and performance of all the athletes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This feature works with other features such as <code>find</code> or <code>filter</code> which reduces the need to
 go through the list when looking for a specific athlete. For this feature, there were many design alternatives to
 consider as there are many ways it could be implemented. The current choice of design was used because it was
in line with the other features my group mates had implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I felt that the implementation was quite challenging because it requires a certain knowledge on how to use tools
such as JavaFX and SceneBuilder which were used to design the graphical user interface (GUI). With no prior experience, the learning
curve was steep which required more effort to learn about these tools.</p>

<h3 id="select-feature"><a class="link" href="#select-feature">4.1. Select feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>select</code> feature allows user to view the profile of a selected athlete.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">4.1.1. Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of the <code>select</code> feature consists of two parts, mainly the implementation of the command and the
implementation of the UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of the command is facilitated by <code><span class="green">SelectCommand</span></code> class. It extends
<code><span class="green">Command</span></code> and parses the arguments using <code><span class="green">SelectCommandParser</span></code>. It implements one operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code><span class="green">CommandResult#execute()</span></code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Executes the selectCommand which returns the athlete selected to be displayed in
the
UI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of the UI portion for the <code>select</code> feature  is facilitated by <code><span class="green">InformationDisplay</span></code>. It
extends
<code><span class="green">UiPart&lt;Region&gt;</span></code> and displays the personal information of the selected athlete. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code><span class="green">InformationDisplay#displayPersonalInfo()</span></code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Displays the personal information of the selected athlete
such as the name, email, address, phone number and other personal details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><span class="green">InformationDisplay#performanceDisplay()</span></code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Displays the performance of the selected athlete, which includes
the event, best performance and most recent performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example usage scenario is given below which elaborates how the <code>select</code> feature behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user executes the <code>select 3</code> command. The command is then parsed by <code><span class="green">SelectCommandParser</span></code> which
creates
an instance of <code><span class="green">SelectCommand</span></code>. <code><span class="green">SelectCommand</span></code> retrieves the athlete based on the index of the list
panel on the left.
When the command is executed, the athlete selected at the specified index will be stored in <code><span class="green">ModelManager</span></code> as
<code><span class="green">selectedPerson</span></code> using the operation <code><span class="green">Model#storePerson(Person)</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. After the command has been executed, the selected athlete is retrieved in the MainWindow class. It checks
whether an athlete has been selected and displays the selected athlete&#8217;s personal information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram below summarises the steps of the example scenario when a user executes the <code>select</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/SelectActivityDiagram.png" alt="SelectActivityDiagram" width="330">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Activity diagram of <code>select</code> command execution</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation was done this way because the Ui component interacts with both the Logic and Model component.
Firstly, the Ui component takes in the input from the user and allows <code><span class="green">SelectCommandParser</span></code> in Logic component
to parse the argument.
After the argument has been parsed, the athlete is stored in the Model component which houses most of the data in the
app. The Ui listens for any changes made to the Model data, and updates the Ui to display the selected athlete.</p>

<p>Reason: In the end, I went with alternative 1 because it was more intuitive to use and was in line with some of the
other functions such as <code><span class="green">DeleteCommand</span></code> or <code><span class="green">FindCommand</span></code> which also uses index. It also reduces the
need to type out the full name of the selected athlete.</p>

<p>The sub feature of <code><span class="green">AddCommand</span></code> and <code><span class="green">EditCommand</span></code> allows the inclusion of photo for an athlete.</p>

<h4 id="implementation-2"><a class="link" href="#implementation-2">4.2.1. Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sub feature is facilitated by <code><span class="green">Photo</span></code>. It is similar to the other features such as <code><span class="green">Name</span></code> and
<code><span class="green">Phone</span></code> which uses a prefix <code>i/</code> followed by the file name (e.g. <code>i/default.png</code>). Prior to adding the photo
of an athlete, the image file that is going to be used has to be in the <code>images</code> folder which will be generated when the
jar file is executed. <code><span class="green">Photo</span></code> takes in the file name as a <code><span class="green">String</span></code> and retrieves the photo to be added
or edited from the <code>images</code> folder.</p>

<p>Reason: Alternative 1 was chosen because it simplifies the parsing of the filename and reduces the error it might
have if special characters were included.</p>
