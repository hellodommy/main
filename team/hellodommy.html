<h2 id="introduction"><a class="link" href="#introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project portfolio details my key contributions to the team software engineering project, <strong>Athletick</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The team consists of five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates in the National University of Singapore
(NUS), including myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project was completed as part of a CS2103T Software Engineering module offered by the NUS School of Computing.
We were given six weeks to either <em>morph</em> or <em>enhance</em> an existing Java project,
<a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3">Address Book</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We chose to morph the project into <strong>Athletick</strong>, a tool for coaches and captains to use to keep track of their
team&#8217;s <em>attendance</em> and <em>performance</em>. <strong>Athletick</strong> also features a calendar for coaches and captains to plan
their schedules, and supports the sorting, filtering, and searching of athletes in their database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like Address Book, <strong>Athletick</strong> uses the command-line as its main method of input and a JavaFX Graphical User
Interface for display. Some constraints of the project were that it should have a command-line input, and
it should be used by a single user only. The full list of constraints can be found
<a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/website/admin/project-constraints.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to build the <em>Performance</em> feature, which encompasses the adding, deleting and viewing of
events and records.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">2. Summary of Contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to <strong>Athletick</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Major enhancement added:</strong>  I added the ability to <em>add</em>, <em>delete</em>, and <em>view</em> events and records.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows coaches and captains to log records that an athlete completed for a certain
event, on a certain day, into <strong>Athletick</strong>. An event can store multiple records over time for the same athlete
to track their progress, which can be visualised with a line chart provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: It is crucial for coaches and captains to track the progress of their team over time,
hence the ability to add records. There are also different types of recordings to take in a sports team&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;2.4km run, static jump, etc.&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; hence the ability to add records <em>under different events</em>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability to delete records and events was also necessary, as teams may no longer participate in certain
events, or records can be entered incorrectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The presentation of record progress over a line chart was meant to give coaches and captains a quick
overview of their athlete&#8217;s fitness status.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement works well with future extensions to further analyse and present the records
data as the required framework has been built.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary due to the complex structure of the records data
which required efficient storage and retrieval. There was up to 4 levels of nesting  - a list of events,
each event with a list of athletes paired with their personal list of records, each record having a date and
timing. This also made the implementation exceptionally challenging.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minor enhancement added:</strong> I added the ability to <em>filter</em> athletes by their tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows captains and coaches to find athletes through their tags. Filtering by multiple
tags is supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: When there are many athletes in a team, tags are a useful way of remembering certain
details about a particular athlete. This function enhances the existing tag feature by allowing users with
certain tags to be filtered out of the general athlete list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement provides the necessary framework for further types of filtering, such as by
gender or location.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">4.1.1. Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section explains how <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code> is implemented in Athletick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code><span class="green">ModelManager</span></code> has a <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code>, which has a <code><span class="green">UniqueEventList</span></code>.
Every <code><span class="green">Event</span></code> in Athletick is stored in this <code><span class="green">UniqueEventList</span></code>.
The class diagram below shows how the different components mentioned interact with one another.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 3. Class diagram for showing how Performance is implemented with Model and Logic.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the name suggests, all <code><span class="green">Event</span></code> names are unique in <code><span class="green">UniqueEventList</span></code>.
This is ensured by <code><span class="green">UniqueEventList#contains()</span></code> that checks whether there is an <code><span class="green">Event</span></code>
with the same name before the <code><span class="green">Event</span></code> is added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every event has its own <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a>
where performances under this event are stored.
The <em>key</em> of the HashMap is the <code><span class="green">Person</span></code> that the performance records will be under, while the <em>value</em>
of the HashMap is a list of <code><span class="green">Record</span></code> s under the <code><span class="green">Person</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This structure allows each <code><span class="green">Person</span></code> to have multiple <code><span class="green">Record</span></code> s stored in Athletick so
their progress over time can be analysed using the <code><span class="green">AthletickDate</span></code> and <code><span class="green">Timing</span></code>
attributes in <code><span class="green">Record</span></code>. Additionally, an athlete&#8217;s records can be easily retrieved by calling the
<code><span class="green">HashMap#get()</span></code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code><span class="green">Event</span></code> s are added using the <code><span class="green">EventCommand</span></code>, and <code><span class="green">Record</span></code> s are added using the
 <code><span class="green">PerformanceCommand</span></code>. In these commands, changes to <code><span class="green">UniqueEventList</span></code> are called through
  <code><span class="green">Model</span></code> in <code><span class="green">EventCommand#execute()</span></code> and <code><span class="green">PerformanceCommand#execute()</span></code> since
  <code><span class="green">Model</span></code> carries a common copy of all the data stored in Athletick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Observer Pattern</em> is adopted when displaying <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code> data through the <code><span class="green">UI</span></code>.
<code><span class="green">Model</span></code> exposes an unmodifiable <code><span class="green">ObservableList&lt;Event&gt;</span></code> through
<code><span class="green">Model#getPerformance</span></code> that returns a <code><span class="green">ReadOnlyPerformance</span></code>. It can be 'observed'
and is updated accordingly when data in <code><span class="green">Performance</span></code> changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens in <code><span class="green">Logic</span></code> and <code><span class="green">Model</span></code> when in an
example scenario when <code>event freestyle 50m</code> is given as a user input (ie. when the user adds the <code>freestyle
50m</code> event).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deleting an event (with <code><span class="green">DeleteEventCommand</span></code>) does the opposite. The input <code>delete -e freestyle
50m</code> will call <code><span class="green">Model#deleteEvent()</span></code>, after making sure the event exists in Athletick by getting a
boolean from <code><span class="green">Model#hasEvent()</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operations for <code><span class="green">Record</span></code> - adding and deleting - work similarly to that of <code><span class="green">Event</span></code> as well,
except there are more methods involved as there is a greater degree of nesting.</p>
